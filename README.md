A TypeScript package for sparse tensor operations on complex numbers in your browser - for quantum computing, quantum information, and interactive visualizations of quantum physics. For more details, see our preprint:

- P. Migdał, K. Jankiewicz, P. Grabarz, et al., [Visualizing quantum mechanics in an interactive simulation - Virtual Lab by Quantum Flytrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13300), arXiv:2203.13300

Quantum Tensors are developed by [Quantum Flytrap](https://quantumflytrap.com/) and were supported by the [Centre of Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/), National University of Singapore. They are a part of the [Quantum Game 2](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/quantum-game-2) project, are used in [BraKetVue](https://github.com/Quantum-Flytrap/bra-ket-vue) quantum state visualizer, and serve as a prototype for numerics for [Virtual Lab by Quantum Flytrap](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/), and in an interactive blog post:

Documentation: [quantum-flytrap.github.io/quantum-tensors](https://quantum-flytrap.github.io/quantum-tensors/) (generated by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/)). Some examples of its usage are [demos](https://github.com/Quantum-Flytrap/quantum-tensors/tree/master/demos), [tests](https://github.com/Quantum-Flytrap/quantum-tensors/tree/master/demos) folders.

We base the philosophy of this package on:

- Sparse operations (both for vectors and matrices)
- Complex numbers
- Tensor structure
- Named tensor dimensions (vide [Tensors considered harmful](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor)): there is a difference between a 2x2 operator on spin and polarization. It helps with catching errors.

## Installation

The easiest way is to install from [the NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quantum-tensors):

```
npm install quantum-tensors
```

Or, if you use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager,

```
yarn add quantum-tensors
```

If you want to install a development version, you can get this package directly from this GitHub repository. In this case, the commands are:

```
npm install Quantum-Flytrap/quantum-tensors#master
```

Or if you use yarn:

```
yarn add Quantum-Flytrap/quantum-tensors#master
```

## Usage

And then in your project write:

```{ts}
import * as qt from 'quantum-tensors'
```
